# PerfumeIntroduction
2024 Swift Student Challenge

## Please tell us about the features and techniques you used.
PerfumeIntroduction aims to help users understand perfumes by experiencing characteristics of perfumes that they may have overlooked casually. I have designed it using NavigationSplitView to allow users to easily select and explore four main categories: Gender, Note, Type, and Incense.

Throughout the app, animations are employed to provide users with dynamic experiences, particularly in sections explaining Gender. The explanations for Note and Type utilize AVKit. Note provides the auditory experience of the sound of spraying perfume, while Type offers the immersive experience of the sound of water dripping while making perfume. Additionally, for Type, I have further enhanced the experience by customizing the Progressbar. Finally, the explanation of Incense involves using DragGesture to swipe left and right to choose scents, and rotation3DEffect to flip the card of the perfume bottle, allowing users to enjoy the fun experience of imagining the scent.

## Is there anything else you'd like us to know?
The reason I created this app is because I didn't know the meanings behind the various terms used to describe perfume characteristics. I wanted to organize and understand these characteristics, which led me to develop this app. During the process of creating this app, I realized that the terms I compiled are commonly used in everyday life more than I initially thought. For example, the information introduced in the sections about Note and Incense is also applicable to descriptions of scented products other than perfumes, such as hand sanitizers, air fresheners, and more. It felt rewarding to learn some general knowledge that would be useful to know, and I hope you'll feel the same way.

Perfumes are mostly used for gifts or special occasions. Through my app, I hope users can gain a better understanding of perfumes and make more informed choices when selecting one. I wish you all the best scents to accompany you in your life.
